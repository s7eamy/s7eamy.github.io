# Cybersecurity 101

Cybersecurity 101 is a learning path in TryHackMe. It is an introductory course for computer science fundamentals and both offensive and defensive cyber security. I will summarize what I've learnt from each module.

## Start Your Cyber Security Journey

**TODO**

## Linux Fundamentals

Basic bash commands:

* `ls` lists directory contents
* `file` outputs information about a file
* `find` finds files/directories that match the given pattern
* ...

Common directories:

* `/etc` stores system files that are used by OS
* `/var` stores data that is frequently being access or written by services or applications running on the system
* `/root` is the home directory for root
* `/tmp` stores data that is only needed to be accessed once or twice

General utilities:

* `wget` allows us to download files from web via HTTP
* `scp` allows us to transfer files between two computers via SSH
* `python3 -m http.server` allows us to host a webserver

## Windows and AD Fundamentals

## Command Line

## Networking

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual model that describes how computers communicate in a network. It consists of 7 layers:

1. Physical - physical connection between devices, where data is transmitted via electrical, optical or wireless signals.
2. Data link - communication protocol between devices on the same network. For example, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, etc.
3. Network - communication between different networks. For example, Internet Protocol, ICMP and VPN protocols (SSL/TLS VPN).
4. Transport - e2e communication between applications on different hosts. For example, TCP and UDP.
5. Session - establishing, maintaining and synchronising communication between applications on different hosts. For example, Network File System and Remote Procedure Call.
6. Presentation - converting data into a form compatible with the application. For example, saving images as JPEG and using MIME to encode the JPEG into ASCII.
7. Application - network services to end-user applications. For example, HTTP, FTP, DNS, etc.

The TCP/IP model is an implementation of OSI. It joins OSI layers 5, 6 and 7 into one layer, thus it has 5 layers instead of 7.

**TODO: write about IP addresses, UDP, TCP, packet lifecycle, telnet**
