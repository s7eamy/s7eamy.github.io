## Content Discovery

To discover content (pages, staff portals, backups, admin panels, files, etc.) on a website, we can use three ways: manual, automated and OSINT (open source intelligence)

Places to check manually:

* http://host/robots.txt - document that tells search engines what pages they're allowed and disallowed to list. This may show us possible directories that we can exploit.
* http://host/sites/favicon/images/favicon.ico - icons that appear on our browser tabs. This may give insights on what framework is being used for the webapp.
* http://host/sitemap.xml - document that lists files that the website wants to be displayed in search engine results. This can help find areas of website that are difficult to navigate to.
* HTTP Headers - capturing HTTP response headers may reveal information about the webserver and/or backend software.

OSINT:

* Google Hacking / Dorking - Google has advanced search features which allows filtering results based on certain criteria, like site, filetype, url keywords, etc. It can help find security holes.
* Wappalyzer - online tool for identifying website's technologies (frameworks, CMS, payment suites, etc)
* Wayback Machine - archive of websites. It can help uncover old pages of some website.
* GitHub - version control system server.
* S3 Buckets - storage service by Amazong AWS. Incorrect permissions may allow access to files. For example, tryhackme-assets.s3.amazonaws.com. It is common to name buckets in the following format: {name}-assets, {name}-www, {name}-public, etc.

Automation:

Content discovery can be automated via [wordlists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists). Many tools are available for this task, such as `ffuf`, `dirb` and `gobuster`.
Example gobuster command: `gobuster dir --url http://host_url/ -w wordlist.txt`
