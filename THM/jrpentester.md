Jr. Pentester is a learning path in TryHackMe. 

## Content Discovery

To discover content (pages, staff portals, backups, admin panels, files, etc.) on a website, we can use three ways: manual, automated and OSINT (open source intelligence)

Places to check manually:

* http://host/robots.txt - document that tells search engines what pages they're allowed and disallowed to list. This may show us possible directories that we can exploit.
* http://host/sites/favicon/images/favicon.ico - icons that appear on our browser tabs. This may give insights on what framework is being used for the webapp.
* http://host/sitemap.xml - document that lists files that the website wants to be displayed in search engine results. This can help find areas of website that are difficult to navigate to.
* HTTP Headers - capturing HTTP response headers may reveal information about the webserver and/or backend software.

OSINT:

* Google Hacking / Dorking - Google has advanced search features which allows filtering results based on certain criteria, like site, filetype, url keywords, etc. It can help find security holes.
* Wappalyzer - online tool for identifying website's technologies (frameworks, CMS, payment suites, etc)
* Wayback Machine - archive of websites. It can help uncover old pages of some website.
* GitHub - version control system server.
* S3 Buckets - storage service by Amazong AWS. Incorrect permissions may allow access to files. For example, tryhackme-assets.s3.amazonaws.com. It is common to name buckets in the following format: {name}-assets, {name}-www, {name}-public, etc.

Automation:

Content discovery can be automated via [wordlists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists). Many tools are available for this task, such as `ffuf`, `dirb` and `gobuster`.
Example gobuster command: `gobuster dir --url http://host_url/ -w wordlist.txt`

## Subdomain enumeration
Discovering a host's subdomains expands our attack surface. This way we can find more points of vulnerability. There are three ways for enumerating subdomains: bruteforce, OSINT and virtual hosts.

OSINT:

* SSL/TLS certificates - when a SSL/TLS certificate is issued by CA, it is logged in CT logs. They can be found at https://crt.sh and https://ui.ctsearch.entrust.com/ui/ctsearchui. These logs can help discover subdomains.
* Search engines - Google Dorking can also be employed. For example, via search term `site:*.tryhackme.com -site:www.tryhackme.com`
* Sublist3r - a tool for automating OSINT subdomain discovery.

Bruteforce:

* DNS bruteforce - we can try out hundreds of subdomains from a wordlist via `dnsrecon`

Virtual hosts:

virtual hosting is the capability to host multiple websites from one server. When a client requests one of those websites, the server knows which website to send via the Host header. We can change it and thus enumerate subdomains.

* fuff - here we can use fuff with the **-H** switch. For example, `ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.acmeitsupport.thm" -u http://10.10.84.23`.

## Authentication Bypass

`ffuf` can be used to

* enumerate usernames - for example, `ffuf -w valid_usernames.txt:W1,/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-100.txt:W2 -X POST -d "username=W1&password=W2" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://10.10.65.118/customers/login -fc 200`
* bruteforce passwords - for example, `ffuf -w valid_usernames.txt:W1,/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-100.txt:W2 -X POST -d "username=W1&password=W2" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://10.10.65.118/customers/login -fc 200`

Some other authentication bypass options include abusing the logic flaws of the application or spoofing cookies.
